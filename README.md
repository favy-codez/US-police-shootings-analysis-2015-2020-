![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/favy-codez/US-police-shootings-analysis-2015-2020-/blob/main/Dashboard%202.png)

## Overview
This project offers a comprehensive data analysis of fatal police shootings in the United States between 2015 and 2020. Using Microsoft Excel, this study investigates demographic, behavioral, and geographic trends surrounding fatal police encounters. The goal is to identify recurring patterns, highlight potential accountability gaps, and contribute to informed public safety discussions and policy development.

## Objectives
- Identify which racial and age groups are most affected by fatal police encounters
- Explore trends across years and weapon types
- Analyze the effect of body cameras and fleeing behavior on encounter outcomes
- Determine states with the lowest and highest fatality rates
- Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce fatal encounters and improve transparency
---

## Tools Used
**Microsoft Excel** â€” For data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboards, and charts.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**  
   Dataset sourced from Kaggle containing fatal police shooting records in the U.S. from 2015 to 2020.
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies
   - Standardized categorical variables (e.g., race, gender, location)
   - Converted data types (e.g., age, dates)
   - Structured into an Excel Table for seamless analysis
3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Built pivot tables to examine trends by race, age, state, and year
   - Used slicers to filter data by demographics, fleeing behavior, and camera presence
   - Developed a pre-analysis board to define key metrics and stakeholders
4. **Visualization**  
   - Designed bar, pie, column, and line charts to communicate patterns
   - Built a detailed Excel dashboard to present findings interactively and clearly
